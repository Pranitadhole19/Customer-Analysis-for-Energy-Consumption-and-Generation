# Project-1---Energy-Consumption



Abstract: 
This Power BI dashboard presents a detailed analysis of the energy and economic landscape for the United States. By consolidating key metrics such as GDP, population, electric demand, and generation, coupled with trend analyses and data breakdowns, the dashboard offers a holistic overview of the energy ecosystem. The visual design and data presentation techniques employed in this project demonstrate the creator's proficiency in transforming complex information into an informative and visually engaging business intelligence solution.
Problem Statement: 
Energy and economic data can be fragmented and challenging to synthesize, making it difficult for decision-makers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and identify emerging trends. This project aimed to address this challenge by developing a centralized Power BI dashboard that integrates diverse energy and economic data sources, enabling data-driven insights and informed decision-making.
Based on the details provided in the Power BI dashboard, here are 10 key questions that the visuals in this report aim to address:
1.	What is the current GDP and population of the United States?
2.	What are the trends in GDP and population growth over the past decades?
3.	What is the current electric demand and generation in the United States?
4.	How is the energy consumption breakdown in the United States in terms of different energy sources?
5.	What is the breakdown of electricity generation by source in the United States?
6.	Which are the top and bottom 10 countries in terms of electric generation and demand?
7.	What insights can be drawn from the relationship between GDP and energy consumption/electricity generation?
8.	What is the predicted future trend in the renewable share of energy consumption?
9.	Which regions or continents are included in the machine learning target variable map?
10.	How can the insights from this dashboard be used to predict energy self-sufficiency for the United States?
The visuals in this Power BI report are designed to provide comprehensive data-driven answers to these key questions, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning around energy and economic factors.
Scope: 
The scope of this project encompasses the following key elements:
1.	Gathering and consolidating relevant energy and economic data for the United States, including GDP, population, electric demand, and generation.
